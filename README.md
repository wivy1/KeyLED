## Description

KeyLED is a DIY electronic device that illuminates the keys of any musical keyboard according to a user-selected root note and scale. It provides real-time visual cues for scales, modes, intervals, and root notesâ€”ideal for both novice keyboardists looking to learn scales and experienced musicians who want to expedite composition and improvisation. Designed to be modular, KeyLED adapts to any keyboard width, and can be assembled using readily available components and a simple 3D-printed enclosure.
