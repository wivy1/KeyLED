## Description

KeyLED illuminates the keys of any musical keyboard according to a user-selected root note and scale/mode. It provides visual cues for scales/modes, intervals, and root notes â€” ideal for both novice keyboardists looking to learn scales and experienced musicians who want to expedite composition and improvisation. 

Designed to be modular, KeyLED can be configured for any keyboard length and key width, and can be assembled using readily available (and cheap!) components inside a simple 3D-printed enclosure.
